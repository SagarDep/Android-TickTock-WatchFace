# Android-TickTock-WatchFace
Android experimental funky looking watchface for android wear

While browsing 9Gags I came across a Gif file of clock similar to this image :-

I decide to create this in Android I am able to make roatting dial with angular speed of 30degree/seconds (360 degrees/12hours).
And I am able to change Tick into tock and tock into tick each second.

This project uses feature of https://github.com/ogaclejapan/ArcLayout to create dial and object animator for rotation. 

Note to self:- 
1) Make rotation of "I" & "O" correct like gif.
2) Optimize code for wear.

Practical use :-
1) It will make a fancy wearface. That all I can think of right.
